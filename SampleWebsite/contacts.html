the weapons market, though had a change of heart after a near-death experience.  Iron Man was instrumental in acting as a founder and leader
figure for the superhero group known as, "The Avengers."</p>
<img src="Images/thor.png" alt="Thor" width="500"/>> <p>Thor - Arguably the most powerful Avenger due to being a literal god,
the powers of Thor have played a vital part in Earth's protection.  Wielding a mighty hammer only he and a select few are capable
of holding, Thor isn't afraid to use his mighty powers for the greater good of humanity.</p>
<img src="Images/spider.png" alt="Spider-Man with Cap's Shield" width="500"/><p>Spider-Man - After the events of Avengers Endgame,
Spider-Man has been established as the next big lead of the MCU.  Maintaining the same morals of the Avengers before him, Peter
